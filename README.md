# CS305-Artemis-Financial-Secure-Software
CS 305 secure software project applying encryption, dependency scanning, and secure coding practices for Artemis Financial.

Client and software requirements

The client for this project was Artemis Financial, a financial services company seeking to improve the security of a Java-based web application. The company wanted to ensure that sensitive data was protected during transmission and that the application followed secure coding best practices. The main issue addressed in this project was strengthening the application’s security by implementing encryption, validating data integrity, and identifying potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

What I did well and the importance of secure coding

One area I felt confident in was applying secure coding techniques to enhance the application without breaking existing functionality. This included implementing SHA-256 hashing to verify data integrity and configuring HTTPS using SSL/TLS. Secure coding is important because it helps protect sensitive information, reduces the risk of cyberattacks, and prevents vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches. Strong software security adds value to a company by increasing customer trust and reducing long-term financial and legal risk.

Challenging and helpful aspects of the project

One of the more challenging parts of this project was reviewing dependency vulnerability reports and determining which findings were relevant to the application. Some results required careful analysis to understand whether they posed a real security risk. The most helpful part was seeing how security tools and secure coding practices work together to improve an application’s overall security posture.

How I increased layers of security and future approaches

I increased layers of security by implementing encryption for secure communication, adding hashing to verify data integrity, and following defensive coding practices to reduce exposure to attacks. In the future, I would continue using tools such as OWASP Dependency-Check, static code analysis tools, and secure code reviews to assess vulnerabilities and decide on appropriate mitigation strategies.

Ensuring functionality and security after refactoring

After refactoring the application, I confirmed it was still functional by building and running the program successfully and confirming that expected outputs were produced. To ensure that no new vulnerabilities were introduced, I re-ran dependency scans and reviewed configuration settings related to encryption and security. This step was important to confirm that security improvements did not negatively impact application behavior.

Resources, tools, and practices for future use

The tools and practices used in this project that will be useful in future work include OWASP Dependency-Check, implementing cryptographic hashing, configuring SSL/TLS, and following secure software development principles. These resources provide a strong foundation for building and maintaining secure applications.

Artifacts for future employers

For future employers, I would present the completed Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report along with the supporting code changes. This artifact demonstrates my ability to apply secure coding practices, use security analysis tools, and document technical decisions clearly, which are important skills in software development and security-focused roles.
